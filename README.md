### Schema for filesystem

| ` $user is the gmail account name before the @`

> Directories are stored in a `key` which is the 
> `gmail` + `tokenhash`. this is to reduce collision.
> Each virtual directory in the database points to a file
> location. The purpose is not to fragment but if fragmentation occurs, it can be handled.
> The front end will send a GET 'filepath' to the server which will respond with the file that was requested.
> uploaded files with the same name in the same directory will first be checked to see if the bits are the `same`. If they are, `no saving will take place` and the file will be `skipped`. If it is not, `it will be renamed` and then saved.
